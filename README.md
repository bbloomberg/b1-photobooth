b1-photobooth
=============

B1 Photobooth takes some photos using the PTP protocol and emails them to users. There's a google doc that has some more secrets about how the machine works, but basically when it boots up it starts running this app full screen. 

Make sure the camera is on manual focus and there is enough light. The extra time it takes to focus can cause PTP exceptions. Great!
